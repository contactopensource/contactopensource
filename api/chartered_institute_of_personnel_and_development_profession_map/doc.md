<peopleprofession.cipd.org>

<https://www.cipd.org/globalassets/media/comms/the-people-profession/profession-map-pdfs/profession-map-nov-2024.pdf>

The Profession Map sets the international benchmark for the people profession. Use it to make better decisions, act with confidence, perform at your peak, drive change in your organisation and progress in your career. No matter who you are in the profession, whether you’re a CIPD member or not, the Profession Map is relevant to you.

The Profession Map includes areas relevant to all people professionals (purpose and values, Core knowledge and Core behaviours), and optional areas dependent upon your role (Specialist knowledge).

Core knowledge:

• People practice
• Culture and behaviour
• Business acumen
• Evidence-based practice
• Technology and people
• Change

Core behaviours:

• Ethical practice
• Professional courage and influence
• Valuing people
• Working inclusively
• Commercial drive
• Passion for learning
• Insights focused
• Situational decision-making

Specialist knowledge:

• Employee experience
• Employee relations
• Equality, diversity and inclusion
• Learning and development
• Reward
• People analytics
• Organisation development and design
• Resourcing
• Talent management
• Wellbeing

## About the levels

The Profession Map identifies four different impact levels and details the knowledge and behaviours required to excel at each of them. This means you can see exactly what it takes to make a positive contribution, whether you’re a senior leader, a dedicated specialist or just starting out in your field.

The levels are relevant to all people professionals:

• regardless of your role or specialism
• whether you’re a CIPD member or not
• whether you’re an employee, a consultant or self-employed.

The Standards help you understand the knowledge and behaviours that will enable you to be your best – regardless of whether you move through the levels, or develop and excel at one particular level.

### Which level are you?

Start by browsing through the descriptions below to determine which level you broadly align with. If you identify with a couple of levels, explore these levels in more detail to help you identify which one most closely represents your work. When you know which level your work best aligns to, use the knowledge and behaviour Standards at that level to make sure you’re having your best impact.

As you move through the levels, the nature of your work becomes more strategic, the way you use information changes, and the extent to which you influence and impact others increases.

### Foundation level

Your work is likely to be tactical, and focused on the day-to-day delivery of tasks. You’ll gather information to use in your role, and use information to understand your work, organisation and profession.

You’ll work with and deliver immediate and short-term outcomes for your manager, colleagues and customers.
Foundation level is equivalent to Foundation Member (Foundation CIPD).

### Associate level

Your work will usually be operational, with some complexity. You’ll contribute to the thinking around your work, and analyse information to inform your choices and actions.

You’ll work with and influence immediate colleagues and customers, though your work will create short-term value for a wider audience.

Associate level is equivalent to Associate Member (Assoc CIPD).

### Chartered Member level

Your work will require thinking at a strategic level, and have complexity in the thinking and/or delivery. You’ll critically question information and evaluate it to make judgements and decisions.

You'll work with and influence a range of stakeholders, creating medium to long-term value for a wide audience.

Chartered Member level is equivalent to Chartered Member (Chartered MCIPD).

### Chartered Fellow level

Your work is likely to be entirely strategic in thinking and/or delivery, with a significant level of complexity. You’ll develop evidence-based thinking to shape the profession or drive people change.

You’ll influence stakeholders across the profession, and create long-term value for significant numbers of people.

Chartered Fellow level is equivalent to Chartered Fellow (Chartered FCIPD).
