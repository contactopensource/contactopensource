    Plan Objective and Key Results (OKR)

    Objectives and key results (OKR, alternatively OKRs) is a goal-setting
    framework used by individuals, teams, and organizations to define measurable
    goals and track their outcomes.

    OKRs comprise an objective (a significant, concrete, clearly defined goal)
    and 3–5 key results (measurable success criteria used to track the
    achievement of that goal).

    An objective should also be inspirational for the individual, team, or
    organization that is working towards them. An objectives can also be
    supported by initiatives, which are the plans and activities that help to
    move forward the key results and achieve the objective.

    Key results should be measurable, either on a 0–100% scale or with any
    numerical value (e.g. count, dollar amount, or percentage) that can be used
    by planners and decision makers to determine whether those involved in
    working towards the key result have been successful. There should be no
    opportunity for "grey area" when defining a key result.[3]
