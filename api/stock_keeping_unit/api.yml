    Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)

    In inventory management, a stock keeping unit (abbreviated as SKU,
    pronounced es-kay-YOO or SKEW[1]) is the unit of measure in which the stocks
    of a material are managed. It is a distinct type of item for sale,[2]
    purchase, or tracking in inventory,[3] such as a product or service, and all
    attributes associated with the item type that distinguish it from other item
    types (for a product, these attributes can include manufacturer,
    description, material, size, color, packaging, and warranty terms). When a
    business records the inventory of its stock, it counts the quantity it has
    of each unit, or SKU.

    SKU can also refer to a unique identifier or code, sometimes represented via
    a barcode for scanning and tracking, which refers to the particular stock
    keeping unit. These identifiers are not regulated or standardized. When a
    company receives items from a vendor, it has a choice of maintaining the
    vendor's SKU or creating its own.[4] This makes them distinct from Global
    Trade Item Number (GTIN), which are standard, global tracking units. The
    Universal Product Code (UPC), European Article Number (EAN), and Australian
    Product Number (APN) are special cases of GTINs.
