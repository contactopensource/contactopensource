    Currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes and coins.

    A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state.

    Under this definition, the British Pound sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$) are examples of (government-issued) fiat currencies.
