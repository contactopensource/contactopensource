    International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)

  description: |-

    The International Standard Industrial Classification of All
    Economic Activities (ISIC) is a United Nations industry
    classification system. Wide use has been made of ISIC in
    classifying data according to kind of economic activity in the
    attributes of employment and health data.

    It is maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.

    ISIC classifies entities by activity. The most detailed categories
    are defined by combinations of activities described in statistical
    units, considering the relative importance of the activities
    included in these classes.

    ISIC Rev.4 continues to use criteria such as input, output and use
    of the products produced, but places additional emphasis on
    production processes.
