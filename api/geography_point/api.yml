    A geography_point is a geographic point in space, typically with a latitude, longitude, and optionally with an altitude and/or elevation.

    Comparison of altitude and elevation:

      * The altitude of an object is its height above the earth's surface, typically compared to mean sea level (MSL) or above ground level (AGL).

      * The elevation of an object is its height on the earth's surface, typically compared to mean sea level (MSL) or above ground level (AGL).

    Examples:

      * An airplane in flight has an altitude, not an elevation.

      * A mountain has an elevation, not an altitude.

    Terminology:

      * Above mean sea level (MSL) is a.k.a. "true" such as "true altitude".

      * Above ground level (AGL) is a.k.a. "absolute" such as "absolute altitude".

    Calculations:

      * altitude AGL + elevation MSL = altitude MSL

    Note about mean sea level:

      * Mean sea level changes over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.
