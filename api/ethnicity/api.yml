  description: |-

    An ethnic category (a.k.a. ethnicity) is a group of people who identify with
    each other on the basis of perceived shared attributes that distinguish them
    from other groups.

    Those attributes can include a people of a common language, culture, common
    sets of ancestry, traditions, society, religion, history, or social
    treatment.

    An ethnic category may be construed as an inherited or societally imposed
    construct. Ethnic category membership tends to be defined by a shared
    cultural heritage, ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language,
    dialect, religion, mythology, folklore, ritual, cuisine, dressing style,
    art, or physical appearance.
