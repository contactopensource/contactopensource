    An ethnicity or ethnic category is a group of people who identify with each
    other on the basis of perceived shared attributes that distinguish them from
    other groups.

    Those attributes can include a people of a common language, culture, common
    sets of ancestry, traditions, society, religion, history, or social
    treatment.

    Ethnicity may be construed as an inherited or societally imposed construct.
    Ethnic membership tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage,
    ancestry, origin myth, history, homeland, language, dialect, religion,
    mythology, folklore, ritual, cuisine, dressing style, art, or physical
