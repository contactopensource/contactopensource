  description: |-

    The Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is a code system intended to
    include all units of measures being contemporarily used in international
    science, engineering, and business. The purpose is to facilitate unambiguous
    electronic communication of quantities together with their units. The focus
    is on electronic communication, as opposed to communication between humans.
    A typical application of The Unified Code for Units of Measure are
    electronic data interchange (EDI) protocols, but there is nothing that
    prevents it from being used in other types of machine communication."

    UCUM has been adopted internationally by many organizations such as IEEE,
    DICOM, LOINC, and HL7, and is also in the ISO 11240:2012 standard.

    Terminology note: Both "units of measure" and "measurement units" are
    correct and widely understood, with "units of measure" being a very common
    and preferred term. Both phrases refer to standardized ways of quantifying
    things like length, weight, volume, and time, with common examples including
    meters, inches, pounds, and seconds.
