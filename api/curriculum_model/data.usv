Goodlad's Curriculum Model
␟1979
␟Curriculum exists at multiple levels; what is intended often differs from what is experienced.
␟Philosophical alignment, policy analysis
␟Values and lived curriculum
␟Phenomenological
␟Multi-level analysis
␟Interpreter and mediator
␟
1. Ideological. Ideal curriculum based on values/philosophy. Decisions by scholars, theorists.
2. Formal. Official, written curriculum. Decisions by governments, boards.
3. Perceived. Teachers' interpretation. Decisions by teachers.
4. Operational. Actual classroom delivery. Decisions by teachers in action.
5. Experiential. What students actually learn. Decisions by students.
␟
- Recognizes gap between intention and reality
- Value-oriented and humanistic
- Accounts for multiple stakeholders
␟
- Descriptive more than prescriptive
- Complex to operationalize
- Difficult to align all five levels

Bruner's Spiral Curriculum
␟1960
␟TODO
␟Mathematics, sciences, languages
␟Cognitive development and retention
␟Constructivist
␟Iterative deepening
␟Scaffolder of increasing complexity
␟
1. Any subject can be taught to anyone in some intellectually honest form
2. Topics are revisited repeatedly
3. Each encounter increases depth and complexity
4. Prior knowledge scaffolds new learning
␟
- Reinforces retention through repetition
- Builds deep conceptual understanding
- Developmentally appropriate progression
␟
- Requires careful long-term planning
- Risk of superficial coverage if poorly implemented
- Difficult to coordinate across grade levels

Understanding by Design
␟1998
␟Start with the end in mind; assessment drives instruction.
␟Interdisciplinary units, competency-based education
␟Deep understanding and transfer
␟Outcome-oriented
␟Backward from goals
␟Designer of understanding-focused units
␟
1. Identify Desired Results: Enduring understandings, essential questions, knowledge and skills.
2. Determine Acceptable Evidence: Performance tasks, and other evidence (quizzes, observations).
3. Plan Learning Experiences: Instruction aligned to assessments, and activities that build toward understanding.
␟
- Ensures alignment between goals, assessment, and instruction
- Promotes deep understanding over coverage
- Focuses on transfer of learning
␟
- Time-consuming to design well
- Requires paradigm shift for teachers
- May feel constraining for emergent learning

1. Analyze: The analysis phase defines instructional goals, learner characteristics, and constraints. It identifies the gap between current and desired performance.
2. Design. The design phase specifies measurable learning objectives, assessment strategies, instructional methods, and media. Detailed planning ensures that instructional outcomes align with needs identified in analysis.
3. Develop. During development, materials and media are produced, tested, and revised. Prototypes and pilot testing provide feedback before full implementation.
4. Implement. This phase delivers the instruction to learners and prepares facilitators, ensuring readiness of learning environments and technologies.
5. Evaluate. Evaluation includes both formative feedback—conducted throughout the process—and summary evaluation after implementation. Results inform continuous improvement of the instructional product.
