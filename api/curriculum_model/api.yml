    What are some popular curriculum models?

    - Tyler's Rationale Model: Linear, four-step process.
    - Taba's Grassroots Model: Inductive, bottom-up, seven-step process.
    - Wheeler's Cyclical Model: Circular/cyclical, five phases.
    - Kerr's Model: Four interrelated domains.
    - Goodlad's Curriculum Model: Five levels of curriculum decision-making.
    - Bruner's Spiral Curriculum: Iterative revisiting of concepts.
    - Understanding by Design: Three stages, working backward
    - ADDIE model by U.S. military
    - PADDIE+M model by U.S. Navy
    - Successive Approximation Model (SAM)
    - Universal design for instruction
    - Gerlach and Ely Instructional Design Model

    Considerations:

    1. No single model is complete — each addresses different aspects of curriculum
    2. Context determines choice — educational goals, student population, and institutional constraints matter
    3. Evolution is evident — later models (UbD, Wheeler) address rigidity of earlier ones (Tyler)
    4. Teacher agency varies — from implementer (Tyler) to designer (Taba)
    5. Modern practice is eclectic — combining elements from multiple models is standard

            - Teachers, being closest to learners, should design curriculum rather than administrators.
            - Curriculum is never "finished"—continuous refinement based on evaluation feedback.
            - All elements are interconnected; change in one affects all others.
            - Curriculum exists at multiple levels; what is intended often differs from what is experienced.
            - Start with the end in mind; assessment drives instruction.
