    PADDIE+M Instructional Design Model

    The U.S. Navy's PADDIE+M is an enhanced, seven-phase instructional design
    model used to create, deliver, and maintain training content, particularly
    within the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC). It is a variant of
    the traditional five-step ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development,
    Implementation, and Evaluation) model, incorporating specific Planning and
    Maintenance phases to ensure training meets fleet requirements.

    Phases:

    1. Planning: Defining the scope, resources, and timeline for the training project.

    2. Analysis: Identifying training needs, conducting job task analysis (JDTA), and determining performance gaps.

    3. Design: Developing learning objectives, assessment tools, and the training structure.

    4. Development: Creating the actual training materials, including courseware and instructor guides.

    5. Implementation: Delivering the training to sailors, often via Navy eLearning (NeL) or in-person instruction.

    6. Evaluation: Assessing the effectiveness of the training (internal and external) to ensure it meets operational requirements.

    7. Maintenance: Reviewing and updating the training content to ensure it remains accurate and relevant to current fleet operations.

    Key Aspects and Context:

    - Naval Education and Training (NAVEDTRA) M-142: The model is defined in the NAVEDTRA M-142 series of manuals, which guide curriculum development, delivery, and evaluation.

    - Ready Relevant Learning (RRL): PADDIE+M is integrated into the Navy's RRL process, which aims to provide training at the right time in a sailor's career.

    - End-to-End (E2E) Process: It is a core component of the E2E process, which connects training requirements directly to fleet input.

    - Focus on Maintenance: Unlike standard ADDIE, the "+M" emphasizes long-term sustainment of training, ensuring it is constantly updated based on Fleet Performance Assessments and occupational standards.

    PADDIE+M is used to create a "repeatable and defendable" process for training development.
