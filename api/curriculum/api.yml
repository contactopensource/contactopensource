  description: |-

    A curriculum is the totality of student experiences that occur in an
    educational process. The term often refers specifically to a planned
    sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms
    of the educator's or school's instructional goals. A curriculum may
    incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content,
    materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of
    educational objectives.

    Curricula are split into several categories: the explicit, the implicit
    (including the hidden), the excluded, and the extracurricular.

    Curricula may be tightly standardized or may include a high level of
    instructor or learner autonomy.[7] Many countries have national curricula in
    primary and secondary education, such as the United Kingdom's National
    Curriculum.

    Key aspects:

    - Intent (What to learn): Aims, knowledge, and skills students should gain at different stages.

    - Implementation (How it's taught): The structure, narrative, activities, and resources used in teaching.

    - Experience (What's actually learned): Includes formal lessons, extracurriculars (informal), and unspoken lessons (hidden curriculum like social norms).

    Purpose:

    - Sets clear expectations for teachers and students.

    - Reflects a society's values and educational vision.

    - Provides a roadmap for quality, inclusive learning experiences.

    Ideally:

    - The curriculum defines "why, what, when, where, how, and with whom to learn."

    For example, a curriculum can be ordered into a procedure of steps:

    1. Diagnosis of needs.
    2. Formulation of objectives.
    3. Selection of content.
    4. Organization of content.
    5. Selection of learning experiences.
    6. Organization of learning experiences.
    7. Determination of what to evaluate and of the ways and means of doing it.

    For example, a curriculum can be created in phases:

    1. Planning: Defining the scope, resources, and timeline for the training project.
    2. Analysis: Identifying training needs, conducting job task analysis (JDTA), and determining performance gaps.
    3. Design: Developing learning objectives, assessment tools, and the training structure.
    4. Development: Creating the actual training materials, including courseware and instructor guides.
    5. Implementation: Delivering the training to students, such as by in-person instruction and/or e-learning.
    6. Evaluation: Assessing the effectiveness of the training (internal and external) to ensure it meets operational requirements.
    7. Maintenance: Reviewing and updating the training content to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

    For example, a curriculum can be considered in four ways:

    - curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted
    - curriculum as an attempt to help students achieve a goal
    - curriculum as a process
    - curriculum as praxis

    The philosopher Aristotle held that there were three basic activities of
    humans: theoria (thinking), poiesis (making), and praxis (doing).
    Corresponding to these activities were three types of knowledge:
    theoretical, the end goal being truth; poietical, the end goal being
    production; and practical, the end goal being action

    Cf. syllabus: A syllabus is a document that communicates information about an
    academic course or class and defines expectations and responsibilities. It is
    generally an overview or summary of the curriculum. A syllabus may be set out
    by an examination board or prepared by the tutor or instructor who teaches or
    controls the course. The syllabus is usually handed out and reviewed in the
    first class; it can also be available online.

    ## WHERE approach

    Rhe "WHERE" approach during the assessment stage of the process:

    - W stands for students knowing where they are heading, why they are heading there, what they know, where they might go wrong in the process, and what is required of them.
    - H stands for hooking the students on the topic of study.
    - E stands for students exploring and experiencing ideas and being equipped with the necessary understanding to master the standard or outcome being taught.
    - R stands for providing opportunities for students to rehearse, revise, and refine their work.
    - E stands for student evaluation.
    
    ## Assessment: formative assessment vs summative assessement

    Formative Assessment ("For Learning"):

    - Purpose: Monitor student learning, provide ongoing feedback, and adjust teaching.
    - Timing: During the learning process (ongoing).
    - Stakes: Typically low-stakes (not heavily graded).
    - Focus: Identifying knowledge gaps, improving skills, promoting metacognition.
    - Examples: Quizzes, class discussions, homework, drafts, exit tickets.

    Summative Assessment ("Of Learning"):

    - Purpose: Evaluate overall learning, measure achievement against standards, and assign grades.
    - Timing: At the end of a unit, course, or academic period.
    - Stakes: Often high-stakes (graded).
    - Focus: Summarizing mastery, accountability, reporting results (report cards, placement).
    - Examples: Final exams, standardized tests, major projects, term papers.

    Key Distinction

    - The difference lies not in the type of task (a quiz can be either), but in how it's used.
    - A quiz used to review and reteach is formative
    - A quiz used for a final grade is summative.
