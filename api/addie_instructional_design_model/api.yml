    ADDIE Instructional Design Model

    The U.S. military's ADDIE is a five-phase instructional design
    model used to create, deliver, and maintain training content.
    The phases are Analysis, Design, Development,
    Implementation, and Evaluation.

    Phases:

    1. Analysis: Identifying training needs, conducting job task analysis (JDTA), and determining performance gaps.

    2. Design: Developing learning objectives, assessment tools, and the training structure.

    3. Development: Creating the actual training materials, including courseware and instructor guides.

    4. Implementation: Delivering the training to sailors, often via Navy eLearning (NeL) or in-person instruction.

    5. Evaluation: Assessing the effectiveness of the training (internal and external) to ensure it meets operational requirements.
