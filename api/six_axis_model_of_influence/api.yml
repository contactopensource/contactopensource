    The Six-Axis Model Of Influence by Chase Hughes is how he coaches his staff.

    The model illustrates potential for influence. It can be used both as a
    planning tool to ensure a conversation is as persuasive as possible, and a
    post-mortem tool to figure out what went wrong, or what worked best in an
    interaction. 

    The model is described in the book "The Behavior Ops Model" by Chase Hughes.
