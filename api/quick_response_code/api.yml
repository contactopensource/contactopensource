    A quick-response (QR) code is a type of two-dimensional matrix barcode.

    It features black squares on a white background with fiducial markers,
    readable by imaging devices like cameras, and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon
    error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The
    required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both the
    horizontal and the vertical components of the QR image.

    Whereas a barcode is a machine-readable optical image that contains
    information specific to the labeled item, the QR code contains the data for
    a locator, an identifier, and web-tracking. To store data efficiently, QR
    codes use four standardized modes of encoding: numeric, alphanumeric, byte
    or binary, and kanji.[5] Compared to standard UPC barcodes, the QR labeling
    system was applied beyond the automobile industry because of faster reading
    of the optical image and greater data-storage capacity in applications such
    as product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document
    management, and general marketing.[4]
