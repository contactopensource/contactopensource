    A passport credential, such as a government passport for travel.

    A passport is an official travel document issued by a government that
    certifies a person's identity and nationality for international travel.[1] A
    passport allows its bearer to enter and temporarily reside in a foreign
    country, access local aid and protection, and obtain consular assistance
    from their government. In addition to facilitating travel, passports are a
    key mechanism for border security and regulating migration; they may also
    serve as official identification for various domestic purposes.
