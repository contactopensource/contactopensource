    Microdata item specification for identifying content such as text, images, videos, etc.

    Microdata is a WHATWG HTML specification used to nest metadata within
    existing content on web pages. Search engines, web crawlers, and browsers
    can extract and process Microdata from a web page and use it to provide a
    richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit greatly from
    direct access to Microdata because it allows them to understand the
    information on web pages and provide more relevant results to users.
    Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary to describe an item and name-value
    pairs to assign values to its properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide
    a simpler way of annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than
    the similar approaches of using RDFa and microformats.

            specified item property. The property's name and value context
            are described by the item's vocabulary. Properties values
            usually consist of string values, but can also use URLs using
            the a element and its href attribute, the img element and its
            src attribute, or other elements that link to or embed external
            resources.
