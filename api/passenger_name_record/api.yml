    Passenger Name Record (PNR)

  description: |-

    Passenger Name Record (PNR) is the basic form of computerized travel record.

    PNRs are the records about each airline passenger that are being used USA government’s passenger surveillance and permission system and “no-fly” lists, and compiled into the Automated Targeting System (ATS) and other databases of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) divisions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

    Passenger Name Records are commercial records used to store airline reservations and records related to other travel services. A single PNR can contain data about an entire family or tour group, and about all services for their trip from multiple providers: air and train travel, hotels, car hire, etc.

    Perhaps the best way to conceptualize PNR data is as “metadata about the movements of our bodies.
