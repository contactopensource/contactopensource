    Plan milestone, such as a given deliverable at a given time.

    A milestone is a tool used in project management to mark a specific point
    along a project timeline. These points may signal anchors such as a project
    start and end date, or a need for external review or input and budget
    checks. Some contracts for products include a "milestone fee" that may be
    paid out when certain points are achieved.

    In many instances, milestones do not impact project duration. Instead, they
    focus on major progress points that must be reached to achieve success.

    Milestones can add significant value to project scheduling. When combined
    with a scheduling methodology such as program evaluation and review
    technique or the critical path method, milestones allow project managers to
    much more accurately determine whether or not the project is on schedule. By
    constraining the dates associated with milestones, the critical path can be
    determined for major schedule intervals in addition to the entire project.
    Slack/float can also be calculated on each schedule interval. This
    segmentation of the project schedule into intervals allows earlier
    indication of schedule problems and a better view into the activities for
    which completion is critical.

    Milestones are like dashboard reviews of a project. A number of activities,
    which were planned at the beginning of the project with their individual
    timelines, are reviewed for their status. This process also gives an
    opportunity to check the health of the project.

    Milestones are frequently used to monitor the progress, but limitations to
    their effectiveness exist. They usually show progress only on the critical
    path, and ignore noncritical activities. Resources are commonly moved from
    noncritical activities to critical activities to ensure that milestones are
    met. This gives the impression that the project is on schedule, when
    actually some activities are being ignored.
