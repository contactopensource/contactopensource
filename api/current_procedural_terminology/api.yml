  summary: |-

    Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code active as of 2025-01.

  description: |-

    The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set describes medical,
    surgical, and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform
    information about medical services and procedures among physicians, coders,
    patients, accreditation organizations, and payers for administrative,
    financial, and analytical purposes.

    CPT coding is similar to ICD-10-CM coding, except that it identifies the
    services rendered, rather than the diagnosis on the claim. Whilst the
    ICD-10-PCS codes also contains procedure codes, those are only used in the
    inpatient setting.
