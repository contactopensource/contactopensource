    An organization, such as a company, team, club, congregation, etc.

    An organization or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling
    differences), is an entity—such as a company, or corporation or an
    institution (formal organization), or an association—comprising one or more
    people and having a particular purpose.

    There are a variety of types of organizations, including corporations,
    governments, non-governmental organizations, political organizations,
    international organizations, religious organizations, armed forces,
    charities, not-for-profit corporations, partnerships, cooperatives,
    educational institutions, sports teams, secret societies, resistance
    movements.

    Organizations and institutions can be synonymous, or can be distinct in the
    sense that organizations contain internal institutions (that govern
    interactions between the members of the organizations).

    Compare the concept of social groups, which may include non-organizations.
