    Plan ROPE estimation criteria: Realistic, Optimistic, Pessimistic, Equilibristic.

    * Realistic: based on work being typical, reasonable, plausible, and usual.

    * Optimistic: based on work turning out to be notably easy, or fast, or lucky.

    * Pessimistic: based on work turning out to be notably hard, or slow, or unlucky.

    * Equilibristic: based on success as 50% likely such as for critical chains and simulations.
