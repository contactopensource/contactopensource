  description: |-

    The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology that is used worldwide for tracking trade items in stores.

    The chosen symbology has bars (or spaces) of exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 units
    wide each; each decimal digit to be encoded consists of two bars and two
    spaces chosen to have a total width of 7 units, in both an "even" and an
    "odd" parity form, which enables being scanned in either direction. Special
    "guard patterns" (3 or 5 units wide, not encoding a digit) are intermixed to
    help decoding.

    A UPC (technically, a UPC-A) consists of 12 digits that are uniquely
    assigned to each trade item. The international GS1 organisation assigns the
    digits used for both the UPC and the related International Article Number
    (EAN) barcode.[1] UPC data structures are a component of Global Trade Item
    Numbers (GTINs) and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on
    international standards. Some retailers, such as clothing and furniture, do
    not use the GS1 system, instead using other barcode symbologies or article
    number systems. Some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but do not
    use a GTIN for products sold only in their own stores.
