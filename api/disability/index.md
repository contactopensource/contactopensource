# disability

Disability is the experience of any condition that makes it more difficult for a person to do certain activities or have equitable access within a given society.

Disabilities may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Disabilities can be present from birth or can be acquired during a person's lifetime. Historically, disabilities have only been recognized based on a narrow set of criteriaâ€”however, disabilities are not binary and can be present in unique characteristics depending on the individual.[2] A disability may be readily visible, or invisible in nature.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability as including: long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.[3]
