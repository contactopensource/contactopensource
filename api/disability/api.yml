  description: |-

    Disability is the experience of any condition that makes it more difficult
    for a person to have equitable access within a given society, or to do
    certain activities.

    Disabilities may be cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental,
    physical, sensory, or a combination of multiple factors. Disabilities can be
    present from birth or can be acquired during a person's lifetime.
    Historically, disabilities have only been recognized based on a narrow set
    of criteria—however, disabilities are not binary and can be present in
    unique characteristics depending on the individual.[2] A disability may be
    readily visible, or invisible in nature.

    The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
    defines disability as including: long-term physical, mental, intellectual or
    sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder [a
    person's] full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with
    others.[3]
