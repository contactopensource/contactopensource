    The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) identifier

    https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_International_Authority_File

    A VIAF record receives a standard data number, contains the primary "see"
    and "see also" records from the original documents, and refers to the
    original authority records. The data is made available online and is
    available for research and, data exchange and sharing.

    Researchers group VIAF with the International Standard Name Identifier and
    ORCID systems, describing all three as "loosely coordinated efforts to
    standardize name forms". All three systems attempt to solve the problem of
    author name disambiguation, which has grown in scale as the quantity of data
    multiplies. VIAF, unlike the other two systems, is led by libraries, as
    opposed to individual authors or creators.
