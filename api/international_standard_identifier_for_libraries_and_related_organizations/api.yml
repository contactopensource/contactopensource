  summary: International Standard Identifier for Libraries and Related Organizations (ISIL)
  description: |-
    The International Standard Identifier for Libraries and Related
    Organizations (ISIL) assigns unique identifiers to libraries and related
    organisations, such as archives and museums.

    ISIL is also ISO 15511:2019.

    An ISIL identifies an organization, or one of its subordinate units, which
    is responsible for an action or service in an informational environment
    (e.g. creation of machine-readable information).

    Since ISO 15511:2011 allows the use of existing codes to be incorporated
    into the ISIL, it is possible that a given organization can have more than
    one ISIL. However, it is the intention of ISO 15511:2011 to minimize the
    number of codes.

    An ISIL is alphanumeric, with a maximum of 16 characters.

    Valid symbols are A-Z, 0-9, solidus, hyphen-minus and colon.

    An ISIL consists of a prefix identifying the authority which issued the
    ISIL, a dash, and then an identifier issued by that authority. All two
    letter prefixes are reserved for the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code,
    followed by an identifier assigned by that country's national library
    authority. Global-level identifiers can also be assigned, which are not
    associated with a particular country, e.g. 'oclc-' for the OCLC. The suffix
    is generally a pre-existing system of identifying libraries; thus, ISIL
    unifies existing systems around the world rather than instituting an entire
    system from scratch.
