    Plan with ROPE estimation criteria:

    * Realistic: based on work being typical, reasonable, plausible, and usual.
    * Optimistic: based on work turning out to be notably easy, or fast, or lucky.
    * Pessimistic: based on work turning out to be notably hard, or slow, or unlucky.
    * Equilibristic: based on success as 50% likely such as for critical chains and simulations.
