  description: |-

    A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and
    resources, used to achieve an objective to do something. It is commonly
    understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects
    to achieve a goal.

    Plans can be formal or informal:

    * Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to
    occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military
    campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. In
    most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for
    example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and
    money.

    * Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their
    pursuits.

    The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame,
    and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent
    of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the
    short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational
    categories.
