    Gender is a range of social-cultural systems.

  description: |-

    Gender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender. Gender identity
    can correspond to a person's assigned sex or can differ from it. In most
    individuals, the various biological determinants of sex are congruent and
    consistent with the individual's gender identity. Gender expression
    typically reflects a person's gender identity, but this is not always the
    case While a person may express behaviors, attitudes, and appearances
    consistent with a particular gender role, such expression may not
    necessarily reflect their gender identity. The term gender identity was
    coined by psychiatry professor Robert J. Stoller in 1964 and popularized by
    psychologist John Money.

    In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes
    associated with males and females, a gender binary to which most people
    adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all
    aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, gender
    expression, and sexual orientation. Some people do not identify with some,
    or all, of the aspects of gender associated with their biological sex; some
    of those people are transgender, non-binary, or genderqueer. Some societies
    have third gender categories.
