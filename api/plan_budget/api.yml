    Plan budget, such as the cost.

  description: |-

    Plan budget, such as how much the plan costs and/or how many people will
    work on it and/or what resources it need.

    A budget is a calculation plan, usually but not always financial, for a
    defined period, often one year or a month. A budget may include anticipated
    sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities including time, costs and
    expenses, environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions, other
    impacts, assets, liabilities and cash flows.

    Companies, governments, families, and other organizations use budgets to
    express strategic plans of activities in measurable terms.

    Preparing a budget allows companies, authorities, private entities or
    families to establish priorities and evaluate the achievement of their
    objectives. To achieve these goals it may be necessary to incur a deficit
    (expenses exceed income) or, on the contrary, it may be possible to save, in
    which case the budget will present a surplus (income exceed expenses).

    In the field of commerce, a budget is also a financial document or report
    that details the cost that a service will have if performed. Whoever makes
    the budget must adhere to it and cannot change it if the client accepts the
    service.

    A budget expresses intended expenditures along with proposals for how to
    meet them with resources. A budget may express a surplus, providing
    resources for use at a future time, or a deficit in which expenditures
    exceed income or other resources.
