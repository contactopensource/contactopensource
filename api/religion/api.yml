  description: |-

    Religion is a range of social-cultural systems, including designated
    behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified
    places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity
    to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no
    scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion. It is an
    essentially contested concept.

    Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the
    divine, sacredness, faith, and a supernatural being or beings.

    There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide,[10] though
    nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. Four
    religions—Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism—account for over 77%
    of the world's population, and 92% of the world either follows one of those
    four religions or identifies as nonreligious,[11] meaning that the vast
    majority of remaining faiths account for only 8% of the population combined.
