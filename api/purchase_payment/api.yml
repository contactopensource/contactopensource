    A payment is the tender of something of value, such as money or its
    equivalent, by one party (such as a person or company) to another in
    exchange for goods or services provided by them, or to fulfill a legal
    obligation or philanthropy desire. The party making the payment is commonly
    called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment. Whilst
    payments are often made voluntarily, some payments are compulsory, such as
    payment of a fine.

    Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example:

    * the use of money, whether through cash, cheque, mobile payment or bank
    transfers.

    * the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, the
    exchange of one good or service for another.
