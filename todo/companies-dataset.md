# Companies dataset

Free Dataset - Companies
Overview

Updated: 05/01/2023

This collection of data includes over fifteen million global companies. The dataset has information such as a company's name, website domain, size, year founded, industry, city/state, country and the handle of their LinkedIn URL.

To download the data, create a free account.

Note: This is a raw, source dataset. This means that the website domains aren't always reliable - a domain may not resolve (e.g. company no longer exists), the domain redirects (e.g. company was acquired), or the domain is a free email provider (e.g. gmail.com). If resolving the domain is important to your use case, our paid datasets handle these issues.
