# Range

In our work, we use the term "Range" to mean a lower bound and upper bound.

In everyday programming, this typically looks like one of these:

* `range(start, stop)`
  
* `range(begin, end)`

* `range(lower, upper)`

Be aware in computer science, the term range may refer to one of three things:

* The possible values that may be stored in a variable.

* The upper bound and lower bound of a collection, such as an array, vector, list, etc.

* An alternative to iterator.

Be aware in statistics, the term range refers to:

* The difference between the lower bound and upper bound.

Our choice:

* We're making a pragmatic choice favoring everyday developers.

* We're not making a purist choice for computer scientists or statisticians.
