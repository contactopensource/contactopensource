# Measurement levels

Measurement levels, also called measurement scales, tell you how variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set (e.g. mass, length, temperature, test score, ).

There are four measurement levels:

1. Nominal: the data can be categorised

2. Ordinal: the data can be categorised and ranked

3. Interval: the data can be categorised, ranked, and evenly spaced

4. Ratio: the data can be categorised, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a true zero.

The levels of measurement are cumulative. This means that they each take on the properties of lower levels and add new properties.

## Nominal level a.k.a. categorised

Nominal level means data can be categorised into mutually exclusive groups, but the categories have no order among them.

Examples:

- Ethnicity
- Car brand
- Marital status

Descriptive statistics:

- Equality (=, ≠)
- Mode

## Ordinal level a.k.a. ranked

Ordinal level means data can be ranked in an order, but there's no information about the intervals between rankings.

Examples:

- Top 10 items
- Language ability (e.g., beginner, intermediate, fluent)
- Likert-type questions  (e.g., very dissatisfied to very satisfied)

Descriptive statistics:

- Comparison (>, <)
- Median
- Interquartile range

## Interval level a.k.a. evenly spaced

Ordinal level means data can infer equal intervals between neighboring data points, but there is no true zero point.

Examples:

- Temperature in Celsius. The difference between any two adjacent temperatures is the same: one degree. But Celsius zero degrees doesn’t mean an absolute absence of temperature.
- Test scores.  A zero on a test is arbitrary; it does not mean that the test-taker has an absolute lack of the trait being measured.
- Personality inventories

Descriptive statistics:

- Addition, subtraction (+,−)
- Arithmetic mean
- Standard deviation
- Variance

## Ratio level a.k.a. true zero

Ratio level means data have a true zero point: zero means there an absolute lack of the variable.

Examples:

- Temperature in Kelvin. In the Kelvin temperature scale, there are no negative degrees of temperature; zero means an absolute lack of thermal energy.
- Height
- Age
- Weight

Descriptive statistics:

- Multiplication, division (×, ÷)
- Geometric mean
- Relative standard deviation
