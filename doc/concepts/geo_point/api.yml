geo_point:
  summary:>

    A geo_point is a geographic point in space, typically with a latitude, longitude, and optionally with an altitude and/or elevation.

    Comparison of altitude and elevation:

      * The altitude of an object is the height above the earth's surface, typically compared to mean sea level (MSL) or above ground level (AGL).

      * The elevation of an object is it's height above the earth's surface, typically compared to mean sea level (MSL).

      * Examples: A typical airplane in flight has an altitude, not an elevation. A typical building has an elevation, not an altitude.

    Note about mean sea level:

      * Mean sea level changes over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.
