# International Standard identifier for libraries and related organizations (ISIL)

* [](#)


## ISO Abstract

https://www.iso.org/standard/77849.html

ISO 15511:2019 specifies the International Standard identifier for libraries and related organizations (ISIL), which comprises a set of standard identifiers used for the unique identification of libraries, archives, museums and related organizations with a minimum impact on already existing systems.

An ISIL identifies an organization, i.e. a library, an archive, a museum or a related organization, or one of its subordinate units, which is responsible for an action or service in an informational environment (e.g. creation of machine-readable information).

Since ISO 15511:2011 allows the use of existing codes to be incorporated into the ISIL, it is possible that a given organization can have more than one ISIL. However, it is the intention of ISO 15511:2011 to minimize the number of codes.

The International Standard Identifier for Libraries and Related Organisations (ISIL), ISO 15511, assigns unique identifiers to libraries and related organisations, such as archives and museums.

The Danish Agency for Culture and Palaces is the international authority for maintaining the standard and its registry.

An ISIL is alphanumeric, with a maximum of 16 characters.[2] Valid symbols are A-Z, 0-9, solidus, hyphen-minus and colon.

An ISIL consists of a prefix identifying the authority which issued the ISIL, a dash, and then an identifier issued by that authority. All two letter prefixes are reserved for the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, followed by an identifier assigned by that country's national library authority. Global-level identifiers can also be assigned, which are not associated with a particular country, e.g. 'oclc-' for the OCLC. The suffix is generally a pre-existing system of identifying libraries; thus, ISIL unifies existing systems around the world rather than instituting an entire system from scratch.
